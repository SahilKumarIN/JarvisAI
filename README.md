# JarvisAI
This is a just for fun AI created using python and its some libraries.
Here I have added some features like when i say good morning jarvis then it will return something to me in a voice-based output.
In this file there are some of the commands which is hardcoded and the replys to them are also hardcoded.
When I say something then the input is taken using Microphone and converted to a String I/P then the O/P is checked and then is converted to Voice and is output using Python Library.

So Let's have Fun !!!
